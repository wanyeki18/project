<h1 style="color: crimson">All about Butterflies</h1>
<p>Butterflies originated from North/Central America before dispersing into other parts of the globe in a complicated crosshatch of flyways that ultimately led to their current distribution</p>
<p>Butterflies do actually taste using their feet. They do also depend on an all-liquid diet</p>
<p>Maria Sibylla Merian a German entomologist is known to have discovered the so known butterflies</p>
<H2 style="color: aqua">Did you know that butterflies cannot fly if they are cold??</H2>
<p>Butterflies need an ideal body temperature of about 85 degrees Fahrenheit to fly.Since they are cold blooded animals,they cant regulate their own body temperatures</p>
<p>As a result, the surrounding air temperature has a big impact on their ability to function. If the air temperature falls below 55 degrees Fahrenheit, butterflies are rendered immobile-unable to free from predators or feed.</p>
<h3 style="color: chocolate">Butterflies are Nearsighted but can see colors</h3>
<p>Within about 10-12 feet,butterfly eyesight is quite good. Anything beyond that distance gets a little blurry. Despite that butterflies can see not just some of the colors that we can see but also a range of ultraviolet colors that are invisible to the human eye.The butterflies themselves may even have ultraviolet markings on their wings to help them identify one another and locate potential mates</p>
